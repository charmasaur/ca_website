Mittag-Leffler and Weierstrass in 1876. Mittag-Leffler has several more over the next 12 years which I can include too.

Fornaess has a bunch of more recent things about pseudoconvex domains. Haven't included most of them, but could be worth another look.

Skipped a few refs in 1956_Serre because that's actually not that relevant to the Levi problem, and the references are even less so.
Same with 1959_Leray
