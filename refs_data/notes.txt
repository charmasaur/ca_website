This really all starts with domains of holomorphy, so when did they become interesting? I guess Hartogs, but check this.

Then Levi's papers, which start asking about what their boundaries can look like.

Then all the various theory up to Oka.

Then how it connects with more modern stuff?

Also mention the Cousin problems. Where did these come from? Why are they important?
