Mittag-Leffler and Weierstrass in 1876. Mittag-Leffler has several more over the next 12 years which I can include too.

Fornaess has a bunch of more recent things about pseudoconvex domains. Haven't included most of them, but could be worth another look.

I can basically go as far as I want. I think I should focus a bit more closely on the classical stuff that I cover in the paper.
