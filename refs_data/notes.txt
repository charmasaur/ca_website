Mittag-Leffler and Weierstrass in 1876. Mittag-Leffler has several more over the next 12 years which I can include too.

Fornaess has a bunch of more recent things about pseudoconvex domains. Haven't included most of them, but could be worth another look.

Faber has some which definitely look relevant (around Hartogs era). Things like Cousin problems, etc.. https://zbmath-org.virtual.anu.edu.au/authors/?q=ai:faber.georg
