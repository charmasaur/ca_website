  <h1>The Levi Problem references</h1>

  <p>
  The history of the Levi problem dates back to the start of the 20th century, and is still of interest today. Here's a list of some important occurrences in that history.
  <ul>
    <li>Cousin 1895. This paper introduces the so-called Cousin problems, which essentially ask for conditions under which holomorphic functions can be constructed with prescribed zeros and poles. The questions generalise those answered by the Mittag-Leffler Theorem and Weierstrass Factorization Theorem. Domains of holomorphy are tied intimitely to these problems.</li>
    <li>Hartogs 1906 (holomorphic extension)</li>
    <li>Levi 1910</li>
    <li>Levi 1911</li>
    <li>Cartan and Thullen 1932 (holomorphic convexity)</li>
    <li>Lelong 1945 (plurisubharmonic functions)</li>
    <li>Oka 1942</li>
    <li>Oka 1953 (Riemann domains spread over C^n)</li>
    <li>Grauert 1958 (complex manifolds)</li>
    <li>Narasimhan 1961 (complex spaces)</li>
  </ul>
