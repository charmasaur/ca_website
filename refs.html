  <h1>The Levi Problem references</h1>

  <p>
  The history of the Levi problem dates back to the start of the 20th century, and is still of interest today. Here's a list of some important occurrences in that history.
  <ul>
    <li>Weierstrass 1876. Prove the Weierstrass factorization theorem, about constructing holomorphic functions with prescribed zeros.</li>
    <li>Mittag-Leffler 1876. Proves the so-called Mittag-Leffler theorem, about constructing holomorphic functions with prescribed poles.</li>
    <li>Cousin 1895. Introduces the Cousin problems, which ask for conditions under which holomorphic functions can be constructed with prescribed zeros and poles. These questions ask for generalisations of Mittag-Leffler's and Weierstrass's theorems.</li>
    <li>Hartogs 1906. Demonstrates that there are domains on which every holomorphic function admits an extension to a larger domain, and therefore that the notion of a domain of holomorphy is non-trivial in the case of multiple complex variables.</li>
    <li>Levi 1910.</li>
    <li>Levi 1911</li>
    <li>Cartan and Thullen 1932 (holomorphic convexity)</li>
    <li>Lelong 1945 (plurisubharmonic functions)</li>
    <li>Oka 1942</li>
    <li>Oka 1953 (Riemann domains spread over C^n)</li>
    <li>Grauert 1958 (complex manifolds)</li>
    <li>Narasimhan 1961 (complex spaces)</li>
  </ul>
