  <h1>The Levi Problem</h1>

  <p>
  The Levi Problem was the central problem in complex analysis in the first half of the 20th
  century. It boils down to proving that two classes of domain (connected open set) are equivalent:
  <ul>
    <li><b>the domains of holomorphy</b>, which are those domains upon which there exists a
    holomorphic function that cannot extend beyond the boundary of the domain
    <li><b>the pseudoconvex domains</b>, which are those with the property that if a sequence of
    closed unit balls map holomorphically into the domain, and the limit of the boundaries of these
    embedded balls lies in the domain, then the limit of the interiors of the balls also lies in
    the domain.
  </ul>
  In the case of one complex variable this problem is trivial -- it is simple enough to show that
  every domain is both a domain of holomorphy and a pseudoconvex domain. As soon as we consider
  multiple variables, however, the situation becomes far more complicated. See
  <a href="refs.html">here</a> for a long list of references which were important in the history
  of the Levi Problem, and <a href="thesis.html">here</a> for a survey on the subject which 
  <a href="about.html">I</a> wrote as my Honours thesis in 2012.
