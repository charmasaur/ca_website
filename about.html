  <h1>About me</h1>

  <p>
  I'm Harry Slatyer. I currently work for Google in Sydney as a software engineer. In the past I've
  also tried my hand at being a physicist (I started a PhD doing optomechanics, which involves
  trying to use interactions between optical and mechanical systems to do useful things), a
  mathematician (I did lots of maths at uni, culminating with an Honours project looking at the Levi
  Problem, which is a famous problem in complex analysis) and, presumably like a lot of people who
  learned to program in their early teens, a game programmer.
  </p>

  I think lots of things are pretty cool. For example: universal artifical intelligence, space,
  experiments for testing fundamental physics, using AI to learn about the human brain, writing good
  code, using AI to attack philosophical questions (the nature of consciousness, the question of
  whence comes logic, and so on), using smarts to better utilise renewable energy sources.
